## About
The following project documents and collates information concerned with the 'Solar Farm Design Optimisation & Sustainability Options’ carried out by the Jacaranda Flame Consulting (JFC). The document is concerned with three aspects or deliverables within the bounds of the project being the 'Rainfall Runoff Experiment’, 'Pavement Design Optimisation’ and 'Stormwater Scouring Protection Optimisation’.

Within the rainfall runoff experiment, findings denote that an elevation or tilt angle of 25 degrees of the solar panel depicts an influx in both total water runoff as well as peak discharge rate in comparison with 35, 45 tilt angles and the no panel case.

Within the pavement optimisation review and investigation of this project, geosynthetics have been the primary focus of approaches and materials to be utilised within solutions. 

Similarly, within the scouring optimisation review and investigation of this project, the approaches to be proposed via market research and comparisons include:
- Reinforced Turf Mat
- Geocell
- Geotextile Sand Container
